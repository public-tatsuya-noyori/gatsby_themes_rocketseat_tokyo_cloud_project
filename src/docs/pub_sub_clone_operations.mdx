# Publish/Subscribe/Clone operations
## Publish/Subscribe/Clone on pont-to-point 
### Publish
"A" has main cloud object storage and backup cloud object storage. The diagram of publishing operations are as follows.

The diagram on the left is normal operation. The diagram on the right is backup operation.
The above cloning operations are described in Cron as follows.

```bash
crontab -e

# retry 1 to A_Main, if all failed, try to A_Backup
* * * * * pub.sh A_Main || pub.sh A_Main || pub.sh A_Backup

:wq
```
### Subscribe
"A" has main cloud object storage and backup cloud object storage. The diagram of subscribing operations are as follows.
![sub_sub_backup](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/sub_sub_backup.png)
The diagram on the left is normal operation. The diagram on the right is backup operation.
The above cloning operations are described in Cron as follows.

```bash
crontab -e

* * * * * sub.sh A_Main
* * * * * sub.sh A_Backup

:wq
```
### Clone
"A" has main cloud object storage and backup cloud object storage. Also, "B" has main cloud object storage and backup cloud object storage. The diagram of cloning operations are as follows.
![clone_clone_backup](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/clone_clone_backup.png)
The diagram on the left is normal operation. The diagram on the right is backup operation.
The above cloning operations are described in Cron as follows.

```bash
crontab -e

# retry 1 to B_Main, if all failed, try to B_Backup
* * * * * clone.sh A_Main B_Main   || clone.sh A_Main B_Main   || clone.sh A_Main B_Backup
* * * * * clone.sh A_Backup B_Main || clone.sh A_Backup B_Main || clone.sh A_Backup B_Backup

:wq
```
## Publish/Clone in area 
The diagram of publishing/cloning "Not HUB" to "HUB" in area are as follows.
![not_hub_to_hub_in_area](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/not_hub_to_hub_in_area.png)
- There are 6 nodes of A B C D E F. 
- "HUB A" and "HUB B" and "HUB C" have their cloud storage.
- "Not HUB E" also has his cloud object storage. 
- "Not HUB D" and "Not HUB F" do not have their cloud storage.
- "Not HUB D" publish to "HUB B".
- "Not HUB F" publish to "HUB C".
- "HUB A" and "HUB B" and "HUB C" clone "Not HUB E" to their own cloud storage.
A simplified configuration of "Clone A" and "Clone B" and "Clone C" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/E/"

:wq
```
## Publish/Clone "HUB" to "HUB" in area
The diagram of publishing/cloning "HUB" to "HUB" in area are as follows.
![hub_to_hub_in_area](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/hub_to_hub_in_area.png)
- "HUB A" clone B and D data on "HUB B" to "HUB A".
A simplified configuration of "Clone BD2A" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/(B|D)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB A" clone C and F data on "HUB C" to "HUB A".
A simplified configuration of "Clone CF2A" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/(C|F)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB B" clone A data on "HUB A" to "HUB B".
  A simplified configuration of "Clone A2B" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/A/"

:wq
```
- "HUB B" clone C and F data on "HUB C" to "HUB B".
  A simplified configuration of "Clone CF2B" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/(C|F)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB C" clone A data on "HUB A" to "HUB C".
  A simplified configuration of "Clone A2C" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/A/"

:wq
```
- "HUB C" clone B and D data on "HUB B" to "HUB C".
  A simplified configuration of "Clone BD2C" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/(B|D)/"

:wq
```

## Clone circularly between 3 areas
The diagram of cloning circularly between 3 areas are as follows.
![circulation_between_3_areas](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/circulation_between_3_areas.png)
- "HUB A" and "HUB B" and "HUB C" clone data except "Area 1" data to their cloud storage.
  A simplified configuration of "Clone 3to1" is the following exclusive pattern.
```exclusive regex pattern
vi exclusive_pattern.txt

"/(A|B|C|D|E|F)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB H" and "HUB G" and "HUB I" clone data except "Area 2" data to their cloud storage.
  A simplified configuration of "Clone 1to2" is the following exclusive pattern.
```exclusive regex pattern
vi exclusive_pattern.txt

"/(G|H|I|J|K|L)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB M" and "HUB N" and "HUB O" clone data except "Area 3" data to their cloud storage.
  A simplified configuration of "Clone 2to3" is the following exclusive pattern.
```exclusive regex pattern
vi exclusive_pattern.txt

"/(M|N|O|P|Q|R)/"

:wq
```
The detailed diagram of cloning circularly between 3 areas are as follows.
![detailed_circulation_between_3_areas](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/detailed_circulation_between_3_areas.png)
Normally, "HUB H" clone data of "HUB B" to "HUB H". "HUB H" backup diagram of cloning circularly between 3 areas are as follows.
![detailed_circulation_between_3_areas](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/detailed_backup_circulation_between_3_areas.png)
The above cloning operations are described in Cron as follows.

```bash
crontab -e

# retry 1 from HUB_B, if all failed, try from HUB_A.
* * * * * clone.sh --switchable HUB_B HUB_H || clone.sh --switchable HUB_B HUB_H || clone.sh --switchable HUB_A HUB_H

:wq

## To reduce maintenace cost of the routing catalogues
To reduce maintenace cost of [the routing catalogues](https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/operational-information-service/routing-catalogues), the following items are needed.
- [list of CCCC pattern](https://github.com/public-tatsuya-noyori/meteorological_preprocessor/blob/master/tests/cccc_pattern.txt)
- directory path convention
- inclusive pattern filter
- exclusive pattern filter
- triangle circulation

Duplicate checking is not needed by using inclusive pattern filter and exclusive pattern filter. If duplicate checking is needed, delete --no-check-dest of rclone option in pub.sh/sub.sh/clone.sh. In the case of deletion of --no-check-dest, the transfer speed would be slower.
