# Publish/Subscribe/Clone operations
## Publish/Subscribe/Clone on pont-to-point 
### Publish
"A" has main cloud object storage and backup cloud object storage. The diagram of publishing operations are as follows.
![pub_pub_backup](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/pub_pub_backup.png)
The diagram on the left is normal operation. The diagram on the right is backup operation.
The above cloning operations are described in Cron as follows.

```bash

$ /path_to_sh/pub.sh --help
/path_to_sh/pub.sh [--bnadwidth_limit bandwidth_limit_k_bytes_per_s] [--cron] [--debug_shell] [--rm_input_index_file] [--wildcard_index] local_work_directory unique_job_name input_index_file 'destination_rclone_remote_bucket_main[;destination_rclone_remote_bucket_sub]' priority parallel

[example]
/path_to_sh/pub.sh local_directory pub_p2 input_index_file.txt 'iij1:japan.meteorological.agency.1.open.data.i;iij2:japan.meteorological.agency.2.open.data.i' p2 16

```

## Publish/Clone in area 
The diagram of publishing/cloning "Not HUB" to "HUB" in area are as follows.
![not_hub_to_hub_in_area](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/not_hub_to_hub_in_area.png)
- There are 6 nodes of A B C D E F. 
- "HUB A" and "HUB B" and "HUB C" have their cloud storage.
- "Not HUB E" also has his cloud object storage. 
- "Not HUB D" and "Not HUB F" do not have their cloud storage.
- "Not HUB D" publish to "HUB B".
- "Not HUB F" publish to "HUB C".
- "HUB A" and "HUB B" and "HUB C" clone "Not HUB E" to their own cloud storage.
A simplified configuration of "Clone A" and "Clone B" and "Clone C" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/E/"

:wq
```
## Publish/Clone "HUB" to "HUB" in area
The diagram of publishing/cloning "HUB" to "HUB" in area are as follows.
![hub_to_hub_in_area](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/hub_to_hub_in_area.png)
- "HUB A" clone B and D data on "HUB B" to "HUB A".
A simplified configuration of "Clone BD2A" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/(B|D)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB A" clone C and F data on "HUB C" to "HUB A".
A simplified configuration of "Clone CF2A" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern
vi inclusive_pattern.txt

"/(C|F)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB B" clone A data on "HUB A" to "HUB B".
  A simplified configuration of "Clone A2B" is the following inclusive pattern.
```inclusive regex pattern

## Clone circularly between 3 areas
The diagram of cloning circularly between 3 areas are as follows.
![circulation_between_3_areas](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/circulation_between_3_areas.png)
- "HUB A" and "HUB B" and "HUB C" clone data except "Area 1" data to their cloud storage.
  A simplified configuration of "Clone 3to1" is the following exclusive pattern.
```exclusive regex pattern
vi exclusive_pattern.txt

"/(A|B|C|D|E|F)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB H" and "HUB G" and "HUB I" clone data except "Area 2" data to their cloud storage.
  A simplified configuration of "Clone 1to2" is the following exclusive pattern.
```exclusive regex pattern
vi exclusive_pattern.txt

"/(G|H|I|J|K|L)/"

:wq
```
- "HUB M" and "HUB N" and "HUB O" clone data except "Area 3" data to their cloud storage.
  A simplified configuration of "Clone 2to3" is the following exclusive pattern.
```exclusive regex pattern
vi exclusive_pattern.txt

"/(M|N|O|P|Q|R)/"

:wq
```
The detailed diagram of cloning circularly between 3 areas are as follows.
![detailed_circulation_between_3_areas](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/detailed_circulation_between_3_areas.png)
Normally, "HUB H" clone data of "HUB B" to "HUB H". "HUB H" backup diagram of cloning circularly between 3 areas are as follows.
![detailed_circulation_between_3_areas](pub_sub_clone_operations_img/detailed_backup_circulation_between_3_areas.png)
The above cloning operations are described in Cron as follows.

```bash
[example]
crontab -e

* * * * * /path_to_sh/clone.sh --cron /local_work_directory/ clone_p2 'iij1:not_japan_1.meteorological.agency.1.open.data.i;iij2:not_japan_1.meteorological.agency.2.open.data.i;;wasabi1:not_japan_2.meteorological.agency.1.open.data;wasabi2:not_japan_2.meteorological.agency.2.open.data' 'rakuten1:japan.meteorological.agency.1.open.data.o;rakuten2:japan.meteorological.agency.2.open.data.o' p2 16

## To reduce maintenace cost of the routing catalogues
To reduce maintenace cost of [the routing catalogues](https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/operational-information-service/routing-catalogues), the following items are needed.
- [list of CCCC pattern](https://github.com/public-tatsuya-noyori/meteorological_preprocessor/blob/master/tests/cccc_pattern.txt)
- directory path convention
- inclusive pattern filter
- exclusive pattern filter
- triangle circulation
